for puzzles,
we don't verify the packet
during the parse pl phase, we check signature and then verify the expiration time of the cert with timestamp of the client

parse for 6 types of packets (photo)
parse for all types of payload

payload is a tuple
-- sent on socket as length | param
length is 2 bytes in the payload
